## :exclamation: About

At the time of creating this site (Summer '21), I am a new grad software engineer. I figured it'd be a good idea to build and deploy a web app that peers or recruiters could see to get a good idea of who I am, what I do, how I work. If you have any feedback, it's always welcomed.

## :rocket: Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- Javascript
- JQuery
- CSS
- HTML

## :green_book: Acknowledgments
